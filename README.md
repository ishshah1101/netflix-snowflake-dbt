Welcome to your new dbt project!

# Netflix Snowflake dbt Project

End-to-end data pipeline for analyzing Netflix datasets using **Amazon S3**, **Snowflake**, and **dbt**.  
Raw data is stored in S3, loaded into Snowflake, and transformed with dbt into clean, analytics-ready models.

---  

## üîë Highlights (My Work in dbt)
- Designed **staging models** to clean and standardize raw Netflix data.  
- Built **fact and dimension tables** for analytics-ready schemas.  
- Implemented **dbt tests** (unique, not null, referential integrity) to ensure data quality.  
- Created **modular, reusable SQL models** using Jinja + macros.  
- Documented models and enabled **data lineage tracking** with `dbt docs`.  
- Configured **incremental models** for efficient transformations on large datasets.
